You are given a set of transactions in a CSV file, each of which is either a cash purchase

or an ATM withdrawal. Starting with the most recent cash purchase, reconcile cash

purchases against ATM withdrawals. The higher the date, the more recent the

transaction; if two transactions have the same date, the transaction with the higher ID is

the more recent. Cash purchases can only be reconciled against ATMs that have the

same date or are less recent. If a cash purchase is reconciled against an ATM withdrawal

and has some remaining value, then that remaining value is reconciled against the next

ATM. Reconcile according to the following rules, assuming a cash purchase X, ATM

withdrawal Y, and reconciliation transaction Z:

1. If the amount of X is less than the amount of Y, then Y is the parent of Z and the

amount of Z is the amount of X. X is finished and no longer available for reconciliation. Y

is available to reconcile against the next-most-recent recent purchase in the amount of Y-
X.

Ex. 502, cash-one, 401, 25

2. If the amount of X is equal to the amount of Y, then Y is the parent of Z and the amount

of Z is the amount of X. X is finished and no longer available for reconciliation. Y is

finished and no longer available for reconciliation.

Ex. 500, cash-three, 400, 10

3. If the amount of X is greater than the amount of Y, then Y is the parent of Z and the

amount of Z is the amount of Y. X is available to reconcile against the next-most-recent

recent ATM in the amount of X-Y. Y is finished and no longer available for reconciliation.

Ex. 398, cash-five, 395, 25

Return a CSV that represents the reconciliation transactions for each cash purchase in

the input. Ensure that your program works for all conceivable inputs, not only the one

given! You may use any libraries you see fit.
